Welcome to the website for Practical AI for Business Leaders, Product Managers, and Entrepreneurs. 


Most economists agree that AI is a general purpose technology (GPT) like the steam engine, electricity, and the computer. AI will drive innovation in all sectors of the economy for the foreseeable future. Practical AI for Business Leaders, Product Managers, and Entrepreneurs is a technical guidebook for the business leader or anyone responsible for leading AI-related initiatives in their organization. The book can also be used as a foundation to explore the ethical implications of AI.ã€€
